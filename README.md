<br>

### Running the server:
The following packages are required to run the server:
- Django
- Pillow

If virtualenv is already on the machine, then the virtual environment included already has the required packages.

The virtual environment can be activated using the command

    source virt-env/bin/activate

Then run the server:

    python social_distribution/manage.py runserver

The server is now running, and can be accessed from any browser at 127.0.0.1:8000.

The index/main page will be located at 127.0.0.1:8000, and the admin page will be at 127.0.0.1:8000/admin. The default administrator username is "admin" and the password is "admin".
